# Dreamweaver Color Theme Editor

Edit your Dreamweaver code colors. This code used to be hosted on [my site](https://inorganik.net), I wrote it in 2013. However I have since moved away from hosting which supports PHP. Rather than be lost forever, I've created this repo so anyone who wants to can run this code locally and still use it.

However, I would suggest using a modern editor like [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) instead of Dreamweaver. It's free and has lots of wonderful color themes.
